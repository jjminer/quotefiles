That the sun rises each morning may also be considered a hypothesis,
and our experience that indeed this happens day in and day out serves

It is the essence of modern engineering not only to be able to check
one's own work, but also to have one's work checked and to be able to
check the work of others.

No one wants to learn by mistakes, but we cannot learn enough from successes
to go beyond the state of the art.

"Good judgement is usually the result of experience.  And experience is
frequently the result of bad judgement.  But to learn from the
experience of others requires those who have the experience to share
