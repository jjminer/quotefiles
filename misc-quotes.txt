In wars we pick sides, usually the side that is being threatened.  We

If all the heaven were parchment, all human beings scribes, and all the

It is an unfortunate reality for innate idlers that our modern world

We were on Majuro, the capital atoll of the Marshall Islands, a grim
island group deemed useful by the United States.  It is, frankly, not so
good to be found useful by a superpower, particularly one intereted in
exploring the nuances of the hydrogen bomb.

Shortly after down on November 1, 1952, a bomb called Mike was
detonated, and an island, a home, an ecosystem was blown up, irradiated,
and poisoned, leading many to wonder what is the point of having Nevada.

Majuro wasn't built to slowly, grandly crumble.  It was built with the
ambition of a strip mall, a place for America to traffic trifles to a
people who in a generation exchanged three thousand years of history and
culture for spangled rubbish and lite beer.

I am always stunned by the presumption of nuclear testing in the

I have been called many things in my life, but if there has been but one
constant, one barb, one arrow flung my way time after time, it is the

Apparently this is bad, suspect, possibly even un-American.
    - J. Maarten Troost in "Getting Stoned with Savages"

How do you expect to get ahead? people ask.  But the question altogether

In Washington, we lived in a place where everything was available, for a
price, and yet I couldn't recall the last time I had really savored

is permitted and nothing appreciated.

Some people are attracted to power.  I'd rather be plucking at a ukulele
on a faraway beach.  I was not a soft-leather-Italian-shoe kind of man.
I was a flip-flow man.  And as a flip-flop man I knew what needed to be
done.  My wife would have to find another job in the South Pacific.
    - J. Maarten Troost in "Getting Stoned with Savages"

Washingtonians, it occurred to me, were not flip-flop people.  I
wondered how different America would be if the capital had been located

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore,
