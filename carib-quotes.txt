It was difficult to reach this superior level of leisure after a
lifetime of goals, deadlines, expectations, and business plans.  Not
that Anguillians don't work hard and have goals.  Quite the opposite;
they are just not frantic about it.  And there's always tomorrow.  The
word stress is not in their dictionary.

I wanted to ask him where he was from, what he had done, how he had made
his living.  The kind of questions you don't ask in Key West.

Eventually, he pried the numbers out of someone -- only to find that the
phone rang endlessly on the other end.  Unfortunately, we didn't know
whether this meant that everyone had fled because the volcano was raging
or simply gone to the beach because it wasn't.

My first thought?  We werew about to met our first real-life priates.  This
was from years of conditioning in a civilization that has bred violence as an

Back in my "buy everything" days, when I had a house and a garage, I just had
to have all the stuff.  A better car, a bigger TV, a louder stereo, the latest

moving aboard, over 25 years ago, I realized just what all that crap was
worth: Zlich!

goodies for my boat.
