"To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love, but then
 one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to
 love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to
 be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy, therefore
 to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much
 happiness."
