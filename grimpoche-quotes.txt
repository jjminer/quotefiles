The disadvantage of spending all of one's time and resources on
analyzing conditions is that you will never get to the original cause,
the source of the problem.  You may get a temporary answer for how an
accident happened, but as long as the original cause is not discovered,
you will never be able to totally prevent it happening again.

We are fascinated by conditions.  The origginal cause is not so much
taken into consideration maybe beacuse science has not yet accepted it
or given an explanation for it.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_

Enlightened masters have found the real source of suffering, the real
cause of trouble, the real block that prevents freedom.  Negative
emotions -- anger, attachment, hatred, and jealousy -- are the original
cause that keeps us trapped in the cycle of life and death.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_

Since identity keeps changing, who I am, or might have been, doesn't
matter really.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Your anger will bother you much more in your future life and at the time
of death than any physical problem.  The mind goes with you; the body
stays.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Anger, jealousy, and pride push people to achieve goals, at school, at
work, and in every other field of life.  Though it may fulfill a desire,
whatever success is obtained by such means comes at a great cost.  The
ends should not and cannot justify the means.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Part of the reason we get stuck in self-hatred is because we think, when
we've done something wrong, that we've ruined everything permanently for
ourselves.  But nothing is permanent and nobody is irretrievably bad.
Nobody.

Patience is not weak.  It is full of enthusiasm.  It's totally engaged,
focused, and concentrated.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Patience means exactly this: not submitting to hatred.
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Suppose we're crossing the street and a car is about to hit us.  In that
instant, knowing that our life is about to vanish like a dream, is it
worth hanging on to out hatred for someone?
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche on Ego in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
Knowing I'll have to leave everyone and everything behind, is it worth
hanging on to my hate or attachment now?
      -- Gehlek Rimpoche on Ego in _Good_Life,_Good_Death_
%%
We're human beings, and we make mistakes.  In spiritual practice we make
mistakes all the time; that's why it's called practice.
